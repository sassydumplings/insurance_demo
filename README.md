New Relic Errors Inbox, our error tracking feature, is for developers who need to proactively identify issues and fix them before they impact their customers. It is a single place to detect, prioritize, and take action on all the errors that matter to them. They receive alerts whenever a critical, customer-impacting error arises.

Developers can resolve errors faster with errors from across their stack, including all APM, Browser (RUM), Mobile, and Serverless (Lambda Functions) data, displayed on one screen. Errors are grouped to cut down on noise and make collaborating with other teams easy. Error data persists so even when an error is resolved and re-opened, the context isn’t lost.

New Relic Full-Stack Observability Explorer is an intuitive, modern experience that is the essential, daily view for teams to understand what’s happening across their entire environment. New Relic Full-Stack Observability Explorer includes several new capabilities:

New Relic Lookout provides an estate-wide real-time view of changes in all your telemetry, regardless of instrumentation source - even third party and open data - in an easy-to-understand, accessible user experience that requires no configuration. Attention is driven where it’s needed most through an intuitive circle visualization, the brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. In addition to showing golden signals of throughput, response time, and errors, users can view changes in any signal in their telemetry data that they find important, across all their accounts. Users can dig into changes with correlations, abnormal history, traces, and the ability to leverage New Relic’s Profiles across their estate, to quickly uncover blind spots, unknown relationships, and understand what has changed and why so issues can be resolved well before impacting the customer.  

New Relic Navigator intuitively displays the entire estate in a highly dense honeycomb view with traffic light colors based on alerts so users can quickly explore the health of their environment at a glance. For the first time, customers can explore all their entities that belong to all their accounts, being able to focus on specific entity types or specific groups of entities grouped by tags. Users can easily group and filter across all their entities to quickly zero in on issues. The capability makes it easy for users to explore large numbers of entities. 

Workloads get even more powerful with New Relic Explorer. Workloads already dynamically create a curated view of all the entities that a service (or set of services) encompasses, making collaboration easy so teams can isolate problems and understand their cause and impact. New Relic Navigator is now integrated into the Workloads experience, making it easier than ever before to navigate, sort, group, and filter all the entities that make up a workload.  

Related Entities shows users all the entities that are related to a specific application, host, container or integration making it easy to quickly understand which upstream or downstream services are related to an issue, so that users gain a broader view of the overall health of their system and can troubleshoot issues faster.
